The first thing I added was a column to point out if the overdose was from synthetic opioids or not, differentiating with "Yes", "No", or "Data Value" to indicate that that specific row is not an individual instance of an overdose, but rather a row that displays the total number of deaths in that state thus far, for example.

At first, my code to create this new synthetic/non-synthetic overdose column did not account for rows that were merely totals instead of individual instances. This was quickly accounted for by identifying if the indicator row started with "Number" or "Percent" instead of "Synthetic" or "Natural", the latter 2 being the identifying characteristics of synthetic opioids, AKA a "Yes" in the Synthetic column. This allowed me to create many more aggregate statistics in my actual spreadsheet, and I was able to subtract the "Data Values" from the actual individual instances. 

Links to your data files (the original raw data, the munged data, and the spreadsheet file including the formulas and charts). These can be links to files in your own repository or links to the files stored in a cloud storage service if your files are too large to be included in your own repository.

Describe each of the aggregate statistic you have calculated - include a description of each and describe any insights the statistic shows that may not be obvious to someone just viewing the raw data.
If using a pivot table for analysis, include a Markdown table showing a sample of the results of the pivot table (no more than 20 rows, please), along with a short description of what the results show and any insights they offer.

If using a chart for visualization, include the chart image in the report, with a short description of what the image shows and any insights it offers. See the Markdown guide linked above for details of showing an image.


## Extra-credit

I believe this assignment deserves extra credit for two reasons. This is a large dataset with 60,001 rows. It is extensive and spans from January 2015- March 2023, detailing each instance of an overdose death in each state, as well as the type of drug that caused the overdose. This data is meaningful to me because I lost my 23-year-old brother in September 2022 due to being synthetically laced with Fentanyl unbeknownst to him. I specifically added a column in this dataset to quickly check if the death was caused by a synthetic or semi-synthetic opioid for this reason- it is truly plaguing the country and taking the lives of so many, young or old. I actually took Database Design to aid me in creating my own online database for a product I have designed and conceptually created, a handheld Raman Spectrometer Shield Keychain to instantly test pills/substances for synthetic opioids, it utilizes an online database and checks for the unique spectral signature of Fentanyl and other common synthetic opioids. So, for this reason, I believe this assignment deserves extra credit. I hope to take away what I learn in this class to aid me in my endeavors and potentially lower the number of accidental deaths.
